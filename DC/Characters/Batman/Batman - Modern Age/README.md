# Reading List Information
The lists are based on the Modern Batman Reading Order from this reddit post by star-scrapper on reddit:

## Notes:
The list is a collection of TPBs, but the lists here are using single issues. Given this, there may be some mistakes in that conversion. Please let us know on discord or raise an issue if you see anything wrong.
Where some of the TPBs contain additional single issues after the main story that make no sense (particularly old / irrelevant), these have not been included.  Where no single issues exist for some stories, the entire GN is included.  Where issues are repeated in neighbouring lists, they have been included only in the earlier list to avoid repetition.
