# CBL-ReadingLists
Started off as the Marvel Master Reading Order + Others but has rapidly changed into support all facets of reading lists. 


These lists are not created by me. Credit goes to the orginal authors. I'm just curating them into a single place to hopefully make it easier for people to find what they want to read. 

# Contributing

We are looking for people who want to assit in the efforts to make the best reading lists possible.

## Contributing code (Pull Requests)

Pull Requests

- Only make pull requests against the untrusted branch - never main!
- You're probably going to get some comments or questions from us, they will be to ensure consistency and maintainability
- Each PR should come from its own feature branch not the untrusted branch in your fork, with a meaningful name (what is being added/fixed)
- Make meaningful commits, squash them if necessary
- Try to keep it to one feature/fix per pull request to keep things clean and easy to understand
