# Reading List Information
This is a collection from The Complete Marvel Reading Order site:
https://cmro.travis-starnes.com/

## Updated:
Released January 2024, with data from the end of 2023, for the main orders.  The misc orders was data from the end of 2022.
March 2025: Expanded order is updated with data through November 2024. Thanks to a very dedicated Discord user for the detailed update!

The lists are broken up in chuncks of 1000 of the CMRO list. The lists are not always 1000 because a lot of the issues (especially in the expanded order) are not on comicvine.

## Notes:
The CMRO site is a massive project with a wide following on their discord channel and web forum. You can support their efforts with a gold membership for $2 per month. More information here: https://cmro.travis-starnes.com/membership.php
