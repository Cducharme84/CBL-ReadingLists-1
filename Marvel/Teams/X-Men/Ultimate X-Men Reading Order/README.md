From the site: "The preeminent reading order for those who want the whole story, from the beginning to the present."

## Notes:
An incredible set of lists put together by the site's author. There are a lot of places where only a part of an issue is read, or you switch back and forth between issues. It isn't possible to capture that details in the CBL files, so if you are reading it would make sense to keep the site open and reference it as you go to ensure you get the full experience.
