I based it on the Comic Book Herald reading order which I preferred over the others I've found because it includes some series left out by others (such as Wolverine v2). I've completed up to Xtinction Agenda and stopped there. I haven't actually read these yet (this was originally just for my own use), so there may be some issues that are a little out of place. It also includes the tie-ins to the big events like Secret Wars that may not be fully X-Men related but are part of the event story.
